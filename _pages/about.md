I received my PhD on "Improving the Resilience of Free-Space Optical Links using Structured Modes of Light" in 2020, under the supervision of professors <a href='https://structured-light.org/'>Andrew Forbes</a> and Ling Cheng. My journey in science and engineering began with an undergraduate degree in Electrical and Information Engineering, which I completed with distinction. After a stint in the automation and process control industry, I was drawn back to academia by an irresistible (bucket list) opportunity: an MSc in Physics focused on high data throughput computing using ARM processors for the ATLAS detector at CERN.

Currently, I'm a Senior Lecturer (hopefully, Associate Professor soon) at Wits University in Johannesburg, South Africa, where I co-founded and now lead the Wits OC Lab. In recognition of my contributions to the field and my academic citizenship, I was named an Optica Ambassador in 2023, acknowledging my status as an early-career emerging leader in optics and photonics. In 2023, I also received the prestigious Friedel Sellschop Award for my research. I'm a Senior Member of the IEEE, serve as the Wits-Optics Student Chapter advisor, participate in several conference committees, and act as an associate (topical) editor for Applied Optics.

Here at the Wits OC Lab, we currently work on pioneering various solutions for long-range, low-cost free-space optical communications - something like fibre, without the fibre. Our approach often involves creatively repurposing (hacking) off-the-shelf components - a skill I honed over the years as a resource-constrained young hobbyist, and now for resource-constrained use cases like connecting the unconnected.

My research has been published in journals like Nature Photonics, Nature Communications, and Proceedings of the IEEE. While these publications are important, what truly drives me is the potential impact of our work and the excitement of pushing the limits of photonic technologies in creative, innovative ways.

As a lifelong electronics and software hobbyist and pop-science enthusiast, I find that my career in academia seamlessly blends my professional expertise with my personal passions. Beyond my primary focus, I'm deeply interested in a wide range of scientific and technological fields. From browsing Wikipedia to home automation to software development, I find that this breadth of interests often leads to unexpected connections and insights in my work. I try to channel what might start as naivety in a new field into serendipitous discoveries in the lab... Watch this space for some exciting new projects in Optical Computing at the OC Lab!

I'm always open to discussions and collaborations that push the boundaries of optical communications and its applications. And I'm grateful for the taxpayer funding that supports my work - we're committed to translating it into meaningful advancements for society...
